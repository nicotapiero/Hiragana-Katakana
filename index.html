    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    
    This is a little website I put together explaining how I learned the Hiragana characters. 
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/hiragana-chart/">Tofugo</a> has an
    amazing section of charts, and a section dedicated to mnemonic charts. 
    
    I love the idea of using mnemonics, I think they can really help, but I think trying to do a 1:1 mapping for all of them is extremely flawed for the following reasons:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Many characters look similar</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is just a fact. Just look at さ and ち. There is no mnemonic you can use on one that you can't use on another</li>
        <li>"ni" is に (mnemonic used: "knee"). But does け not look like a knee as well?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <li>Many mnemonics will take great leaps visually:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Anythign Knot related (na on pictographics), sewing (za on pictographics), noodles (nu on picto-graphix), lmfao could be any of them </li>
        <li>(ma on tofugo, LMFAO)/ (A MUTATED SANTA FOR HO LMFAO)</li>
        
      </ul>
      
      <li>Many mnemonics wil take great leaps phrase-wise</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjectives in mnemonics are not useful - an "energetic ninja" (1 hour hiragana video) is not useful, because most likely you'll only remember the "ninja" when the "energetic" was what you needed. Same with an "exotic bird"(tofugo)</li>
        <li>(half a "whole" note is so close to being good... on pictographics), but you're so tempted to rememebr it as "ha" for "half note"</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    Granted, some are so hilariously bad you can't help but remember them because of that. The issue is, you can only do that with so many characters, and they're really less likely to stick if you remember them this way.(cowboy is sadly one I do remember using thsi way)


    <br/> 
    
    I think a much better way to learn the characters is to *embrace* the fact that so many look alike. By learning them as a group, it helps:
    
    <ul>
      <li>You get to memorize mnemonics that actually work and don't have to bother trying to make mental leaps</li>
      <li>You just have to remember the rule for whole group, instead of just that characters, which is much easier to recall (both because you only have to identify the general shape and because now during practice you get more repetitions recalling that same rule, even for different characters)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr/>
    
    Here's an example: let's look at the character ね - there's actually a pretty good mnemonic for this one - "net a fish" (~~granted, I think it could be improved: most people will want to say "reel" a fish but whatever~~). Any mnemonic table will give you something completely different for れ and わ, but if you ask me I see a fisherman in all three.
    
    <br/><br/>
    Instead, I remember it as a story:
    <br/><br/>
    れ (re) / わ (wa) / ね (ne)
        <br />
    (<b>re</b>ady to <b>re</b>el in a fish / <b>wa</b>aaa (sound when catching a fish, lol) / <b>ne</b>t a fish)
    
     <hr/>
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Granted, you're welcome to critique my using "wa" as just a general fishing sound, but in my opinion it's at least better than trying to learn based on just one mnemonic. And that's another perk of this method: you can use these "groupings" <i>in addition</i> to mnemonics
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I will admit, I think the strongest method (but probably the hardest) would be to simply memorize the sound based on the character and nothing else. My method can make reading characters a bit slower at first; you effectively are remembering a formula that you apply to the character and then calculate the result. With time though, you'll become able to just know the sound based on the character, even with my method.


    <h5>
      notes for myself
    </h5>
    day 2: I'm missing Ri (re --- took a while to get it the other way
    around)/Ke a lot

    <h3>Some background I started with</h3>
    
    I should mention that I did Duolingo for a bit before learning Hiragana, and they teach you the following (super basic) words that helped me memorize a few characters:
    
    <ul>
      <li>sensei (せんせい)</li>
      <li>sushi (すし)</li>
    </ul>
    
    As a result I never learned mnemonics for those really, sorry. 
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Also I kind of just learned "ko", "a", and "o" on their own. 
    
    
    
    At the end, once you've covered most of the chart, it's easy to learn new characters simply as "the ones I don't recognize".
    
    
    
    <br/><br/>
    te/me lesson about body parts.... useful
    
    <br/><br/>
    another thing is that once you cover enough characters, mnemonics become stronger ! (knee is a good mnemonic once you won't get it confused for the others!)

    <h3>My Mnemonic Chart</h3>

   These are the ones that I use personally, or that I thought were strong enough to be used:

    <br />

    <details><summary><i>How to know if a mnemonic works for you</i></summary>
    Test yourself when you haven't studied in a while and see what comes back to you:
      <ul>
        <li>If nothing, the mnemonic probably wasn't strong enough visually.</li>
        <li>If the wrong picture, it probably wasn't unique enough visually</li>
        <li>If the wrong sound, it might be too confusing of a mnemonic. Mnemonics where you have to remember both an adjective and a noun are big offenders in this department.
          <ul>
            <li>One slightly confusing one I use is "21" for み - the sound is "mi", and the mnemonic is the phrase "I turned 21, that's <b>me</b>", but it's not "me" as in め. It's just because we pronounce "me" as "mi" in english unfortunately, so typing out み I'll mess up sometimes. Reading though luckily is unaffected </li>
          </ul>
          
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <h3>Tricky ones</h3>
    The issue with trying to use purely mnemonics is that your "image" might
    line up with some other characters. For me it helped to study the similar
    looking ones together, actually. This helped avoid having this "mnemonic
    overlap" as much as possible:
    <h4>Similar looking Hiragana:</h4>

    * honestly, I take the similar looking ones and make them into words "moky"
    (smash player) も き (ver) sa chi he ha ha hooooo は (ha) ほ (ho) た (ta) な
    (na) (like ta da....lol) stacking mnemonics helps too, for example: よ (yo)
    よ (yo) ま (ma), よ can also stand alone as yoyo though i just find it
    easier - it helps me bring them together, and once I know よ I get ま for
    free, and also my brain is more likely to remember the phrase "yoyoma" for
    both of them. It's like a 1/2 shot you remember one of your two mnemonics -
    they work together

    <ul>
      Everything
      <br />
      <li>
        "Two people talking about Versace":<br />
        ver (-) さ (sa) ち (chi)
      </li>
      <li>
        "Yo yo ma":<br />
        よ (yo) よ (yo) ま (ma)
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "he ha ha ho":<br />
          -(-) は (ha) は (ha) ほ (ho)
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Alternate interesting thing to point out:<br />
            よ (yo) and ま (ma) flip vowel sounds when the bar is added! <br />
            よ (yo) → は (ha) and ま (ma) →ほ (ho)
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
            How you'll remember that y turns to h and m turns to h, no clue
          </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>
          "Ke ka ku"<br />
          け (ke) -(-) -(-)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Fishing ones: <br />
        れ (re) / わ (wa) / ね (ne)
        <br />
        (ready to reel in a fish / waaaa / net a fish)
      </li>
      <li>Half-anagram half sentence:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          T bois (Knotta'):<br />
          な (na) た (ta) - guy tying/untying knot
        </li>
        <li>
          (eyeball) "Menu":<br />
          め (me) ぬ (nu) [insert image of eyeball spaghetti] め means "eye"
        </li>

        <li>
          3 looking boys:<br />
          ろ (ro) is a rope, so る (ru) is rope with a [loop]
        </li>
        <li>
          Toes:<br />
          と (to) を (wo) - wo is cowboy/something got in your foot
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Awful mnemonics that unfortunately work:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sideways U looking ones:
          <br />
          う(u) vs つ (tsu)
          <br />
          (not great, but I remember it as "u has the serif, tsu is other one")
        </li>

        <li>
          n variations:<br />
          ん (n) え (e) - I can get behind exercise actually... (only things
          with dot on top, it looks like "i" which is "e" in spanish)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Don't have any yet for:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "No" shapes:<br />
          の (no) when they reach their final forms あ (a) お (o) ゐ (wi, not
          needed tho)
        </li>
        <li>
          Weird T-ish shapes:<br />
          て (te) そ (so)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    ki, mo, ra need mnemonics

    <hr />

    <h3>Character stylizing</h3>
    
    Mnemonics must also be strong enough to still work under a variety of circumstances, which with Japanese there's a bunch:
    
    
    
    Typing/handwriting will sometimes have different appearances

    <h3>Font practice:</h3>
Serifs vs Sans serif can really throw you off if you're not ready for it, make sure to study both:
    <h4>Change font:</h4>
    <button onclick="javascript:changeFont('Times New Roman, serif')">

    <h3>Dakuon</h3>
    
    [insert dakuon table here]
    
    <br/>

    
    To put it simply, 
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Before</th>
        <th>After</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>K"</td>
        <td>G</td>
      </tr>

        <td>S"</td>
        <td>Z</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>T"</td>
        <td>D</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>H"</td>
        <td>B</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>◌゚</td>
        <td>P</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <ul>
      Mnemonics I use to remember these transformations:
      <ul>
        <li>King Kong vs Godzilla</li>
      <li>S to Z (not too hard)</li>
      <li>T D (think words like "tada" (ただ) or "todo" (とど))</li>
      <li>
        HB/HP (pencils, computers). <ul>
        <li>Also circle is always P; as if the original kana is
        the "stem" and the circle is the "loop" of the P</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      
    </ul>

    <h5>The problem children:</h5>
    
    Three characters are the "exceptions" in Dakuon (and technically they were in the basic hiragana table as well, if you paid close attention): 
    <ol>
      <li>じ : "ji"</li>
      <li>ぢ : ji (di)</li>
      <li>づ : zu (du) </li>
    </ol>

    Why do we see the last two with secondary pronunciations in parentheses? Tl;dr of below is: "ji"/"zu" is reading, "di"/"du" is typing (writing). I'd say just remember ji/zu for now.
    
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Full answer begins with how writing on a keyboard works: to get が, you'd type our "ga" and to get ぺ you'd type out "pe". The issue arises here: both じ and ぢ to our English speaking tounges are pronounced "ji", but typing "ji" on a keyboard will get you "ぢ". Same with ず - "zu" maps to ず even though づ should be pronounced "zu" as well. 
    
    <br/>To properly type them on a keyboard, you'll have to do di (ぢ) or "du" (づ).
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    So what gives? Are these just arbitrary new-mappings for these characters? Well, not exactly. 
    <br/>
    
    The TL;DR of this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/408ihe/dzi_or_ji_dzu_or_zu/?rdt=39937">really good Reddit article on it</a> is that none of these "dakuon exceptions" are exceptions at all - the way Japanese pronunciation has evolved has converged some sounds. (Technically, writing *almost any kana* as "za"/"da"/etc is a simplification/romanization to make it easier for us to prounounce (the <i>real</i> sounds are slightly different than the consonant sounds the table is showing for them))
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Anyway, let's look into it from a practical point of view of what you should remember and why:
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Duolingo writes them on their chart as simply "ji" and "zu" - omitting "di" and "du" entirely. 
    <br/>
    
    Bottom line is whatever your study app accepts, you should learn that haha. 
    
    If you remember their spots on the table, "di" and "du" might make more sense, as they no longer will be exceptions. Sure, now reading/pronunciation get hit at the cost of remembering the characters like that, but those characters are rarely used anymore.

<br/> I think it's easier to remember them as legacy characters and remember them as "ji" and "zu", but just keep in mind when typing if I get the wrong character how to fix it.

    <h5>
      An aside about つ
    </h5>
    
    つ is now becoming quite the hot commodity memory-association wise: つ must be differentiated from う looks-wise, but differentiated from す sound wise, but when using Dakuon they're the same 🙃
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    う ↔ つ ↔ す
    
    
    

    <hr />

    <h3>Yoon:</h3>
    
    Yoon is pretty straightfowards - take the consonant sound from the original character and then just add the sound of the y-kana (ki (き) + ya (ゃ) = kya (きゃ))
    
    <h5>
      The problem children pt. 2:
    </h5>
    し shi and ち chi just have to make everything a little harder as usual - thankfully, not too much harder. Just remove the y when you see them as well, so only the consonant from the base kana and the vowel from the y kana:
    
    し shi + ゃ ya = しゃ sha
    
    <hr />

    this dude....つ small つ sucks

    <hr />

    technically also additional letters, for foreign words, but usually those
    are written in katakana

    <hr />

    When you're ready, also make sure to study going from sound → character.
    This isn't necessary, but can help strengthen the mental connections for
    characters/sounds when reading as well (mnemonics help for looking at a
    character and recognizing it, but what aboout being able to draw a "knee" or
    "netting a fish"?). This will be necessary for writing though, but at that
    point you'll also need to learn stroke order.

    tricks coming your way: wait....why is ha and wa the same thing.... don't
    trust the SILENT LETTER (tsu) and the h's ngl
