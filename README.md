# Welcome

Hello, this is my site where I'm writing my notes for learning
Hiragana/Katakana. This part of japanese seems like the first part of going
to the gym - great strides/breakthroughs at first, but you later realize in
hindsight it was the easiest part ;\_;. Oh well, I think that's the same with
everything though - this initial battle, even though future you might look
back and think it silly that you treated it as such a big battle, that
doesn't actually matter in the long run: just make sure you're having fun
learning, that's all that really matters!
