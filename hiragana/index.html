    <h3>My Mnemonic Chart</h3>

    These are the ones that I use personally, or that I thought were strong
    enough to be used:
    <details>
      <summary><i>How to know if a mnemonic works for you</i></summary>
      Test yourself when you haven't studied in a while and see what comes back
      to you:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If nothing, the mnemonic probably wasn't strong enough visually.
        </li>
        <li>If the wrong picture, it probably wasn't unique enough visually</li>
        <li>
          If the wrong sound, it might be too confusing of a mnemonic. Mnemonics
          where you have to remember both an adjective and a noun are big
          offenders in this department.
          <ul>
            <li>
              One slightly confusing one I use is "21" for み - the sound is
              "mi", and the mnemonic is the phrase "I turned 21, that's
              <b>me</b>", but it's not "me" as in め. It's just because we
              pronounce "me" as "mi" in english unfortunately, so typing out み
              I'll mess up sometimes. Reading though luckily is unaffected
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
