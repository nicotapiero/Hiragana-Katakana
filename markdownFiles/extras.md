this dude....つ small つ sucks

technically also additional letters, for foreign words, but usually those are written in katakana

When you're ready, also make sure to study going from sound → character. This isn't necessary, but can help strengthen the mental connections for characters/sounds when reading as well (mnemonics help for looking at a character and recognizing it, but what aboout being able to draw a "knee" or "netting a fish"?). This will be necessary for writing though, but at that point you'll also need to learn stroke order.

tricks coming your way: wait....why is ha and wa the same thing.... don't trust the SILENT LETTER (tsu) and the h's ngl
