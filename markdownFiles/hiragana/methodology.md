[Tofugo](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/hiragana-chart/) has an amazing section of charts, and a section dedicated to mnemonic charts. I love the idea of using mnemonics, I think they can really help, but I think trying to do a 1:1 mapping for all of them is extremely flawed for the following reasons:

- Many characters look similar
  - This is just a fact. Just look at さ and ち. There is no mnemonic you can use on one that you can't use on another
  - "ni" is に (mnemonic used: "knee"). But does け not look like a knee as well?
- Many mnemonics will take great leaps visually:
  - Anythign Knot related (na on pictographics), sewing (za on pictographics), noodles (nu on picto-graphix), lmfao could be any of them
  - (ma on tofugo, LMFAO)/ (A MUTATED SANTA FOR HO LMFAO)
- Many mnemonics wil take great leaps phrase-wise
  - Adjectives in mnemonics are not useful - an "energetic ninja" (1 hour hiragana video) is not useful, because most likely you'll only remember the "ninja" when the "energetic" was what you needed. Same with an "exotic bird"(tofugo)
  - (half a "whole" note is so close to being good... on pictographics), but you're so tempted to rememebr it as "ha" for "half note"

Granted, some are so hilariously bad you can't help but remember them because of that. The issue is, you can only do that with so many characters, and they're really less likely to stick if you remember them this way.(cowboy is sadly one I do remember using thsi way)  

I think a much better way to learn the characters is to \*embrace\* the fact that so many look alike. By learning them as a group, it helps:

- You get to memorize mnemonics that actually work and don't have to bother trying to make mental leaps
- You just have to remember the rule for whole group, instead of just that characters, which is much easier to recall (both because you only have to identify the general shape and because now during practice you get more repetitions recalling that same rule, even for different characters)

Here's an example: let's look at the character ね ("ne") 
- There's actually a pretty good mnemonic for this one: "net a fish" (~~granted, I think it could be improved: most people will want to say "reel" a fish but whatever~~). 
- Any mnemonic table will give you something completely different for れ and わ, but if you ask me I see a fisherman in all three.

Instead, I remember it as a story:

れ (re) / わ (wa) / ね (ne)  
(**re**ady to **re**el in a fish / **wa**aaa (sound when catching a fish, lol) / **ne**t a fish)

---

Granted, you're welcome to critique my using "wa" as just a general fishing sound, but in my opinion it's at least better than trying to learn based on just one mnemonic. And that's another perk of this method: you can use these "groupings" _in addition_ to mnemonics

I will admit, I think the strongest method (but probably the hardest) would be to simply memorize the sound based on the character and nothing else. My method can make reading characters a bit slower at first; you effectively are remembering a formula that you apply to the character and then calculate the result. With time though, you'll become able to just know the sound based on the character, even with my method.
