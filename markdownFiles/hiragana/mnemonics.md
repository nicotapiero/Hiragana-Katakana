- "Two people talking about Versace":
  - ver (-) さ (sa) ち (chi)
- "Yo yo ma":

  - よ (yo) よ (yo) ま (ma)
    - "he ha ha ho":
      - \-(-) は (ha) は (ha) ほ (ho)
    - Alternate interesting thing to point out:
      - よ (yo) and ま (ma) flip vowel sounds when the bar is added!
      - よ (yo) → は (ha) and ま (ma) → ほ (ho)
        - How you'll remember that y turns to h and m turns to h, no clue
    - "Ke ka ku"
      - け (ke) -(-) -(-)

- Fishing ones:
  - れ (re) / わ (wa) / ね (ne)
  - (ready to reel in a fish / waaaa / net a fish)
- "Knotta'" (ones that have a t on the left side)):
  - な (na) た (ta) - guy tying/untying knot
- (eyeball) "Menu":
  - め (me) ぬ (nu) \[insert image of eyeball spaghetti\] め means "eye"
- 3 looking boys:
  - ろ (ro) is a rope, so る (ru) is rope with a \[loop\]
- Toes:
  - と (to) を (wo) - wo is cowboy/something got in your foot
- い(i) vs り(ri):

  - *ri* is longer on the *right* side (doesn't work to remember other forms of it)

- Awful mnemonics that unfortunately work for me:
  - Sideways U looking ones:  
    - う(u) vs つ (tsu)  
    - (not great, but I remember it as "u has the serif, tsu is other one")
  - n variations:  
    - ん (n) え (e) - I can get behind exercise actually... (only things with dot on top, it looks like "i" which is "e" in spanish)
  - Don't have any yet for:
    - "No" shapes:  
      - の (no) when they reach their final forms あ (a) お (o) ゐ (wi, not needed tho)
    - Weird T-ish shapes:  
      - て (te) そ (so)

ki, mo, ra need mnemonics
