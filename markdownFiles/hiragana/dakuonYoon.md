### Dakuon

\[insert dakuon table here\]  
To put it simply,

| Before | After |
| ------ | ----- |
| K"     | G     |
| S"     | Z     |
| T"     | D     |
| H"     | B     |
| (H)„Çú  | P     |

Mnemonics I use to remember these transformations:

- King Kong vs Godzilla
- S to Z (not too hard)
- T to D (think words like "tada" („Åü„Å†) or "todo" („Å®„Å©))
- HB/HP (pencils, computers).
  - Also circle is always P; as if the original kana is the "stem" and the circle is the "loop" of the P

##### The problem children:

Three characters are the "exceptions" in Dakuon (and technically they were in the basic hiragana table as well, if you paid close attention):

1.  „Åò : "ji"
2.  „Å¢ : ji (di)
3.  „Å• : zu (du)

Why do we see the last two with secondary pronunciations in parentheses? Tl;dr of below is: "ji"/"zu" is reading, "di"/"du" is typing (writing). I'd say just remember ji/zu for now.

Full answer begins with how writing on a keyboard works: to get „Åå, you'd type our "ga" and to get „Å∫ you'd type out "pe". The issue arises here: both „Åò and „Å¢ to our English speaking tounges are pronounced "ji", but typing "ji" on a keyboard will get you "„Å¢". Same with „Åö - "zu" maps to „Åö even though „Å• should be pronounced "zu" as well.  
To properly type them on a keyboard, you'll have to do di („Å¢) or "du" („Å•).

So what gives? Are these just arbitrary new-mappings for these characters? Well, not exactly.  
The TL;DR of this [really good Reddit article on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/408ihe/dzi_or_ji_dzu_or_zu/?rdt=39937) is that none of these "dakuon exceptions" are exceptions at all - the way Japanese pronunciation has evolved has converged some sounds. (Technically, writing \*almost any kana\* as "za"/"da"/etc is a simplification/romanization to make it easier for us to prounounce (the _real_ sounds are slightly different than the consonant sounds the table is showing for them))

Anyway, let's look into it from a practical point of view of what you should remember and why:

Duolingo writes them on their chart as simply "ji" and "zu" - omitting "di" and "du" entirely.  
Bottom line is whatever your study app accepts, you should learn that haha. If you remember their spots on the table, "di" and "du" might make more sense, as they no longer will be exceptions. Sure, now reading/pronunciation get hit at the cost of remembering the characters like that, but those characters are rarely used anymore.  
I think it's easier to remember them as legacy characters and remember them as "ji" and "zu", but just keep in mind when typing if I get the wrong character how to fix it.

##### An aside about „Å§

„Å§ is now becoming quite the hot commodity memory-association wise: „Å§ must be differentiated from „ÅÜ looks-wise, but differentiated from „Åô sound wise, but when using Dakuon they're the same üôÉ

„ÅÜ ‚Üî „Å§ ‚Üî „Åô

### Yoon:

Yoon is pretty straightfowards - take the consonant sound from the original character and then just add the sound of the y-kana (ki („Åç) + ya („ÇÉ) = kya („Åç„ÇÉ))

##### The problem children pt. 2:

„Åó shi and „Å° chi just have to make everything a little harder as usual - thankfully, not too much harder. Just remove the y when you see them as well, so only the consonant from the base kana and the vowel from the y kana: „Åó shi + „ÇÉ ya = „Åó„ÇÉ sha
