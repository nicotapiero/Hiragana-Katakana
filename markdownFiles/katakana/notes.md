Comical ones:

"na" is knot - "me" is not

Let's look at the freebies first:

| Hiragana | Katakana |
| -------- | -------- |
|     へ     |     ヘ     |
|          |      リ    |
|          |      モ    |

Some kinda look close enough. Some people you should study katakana/hiragana at the same time (idt anyone actually does), but I imagine if you did then it might be easier to associate these together in your head
Kinda look close enough

|  Hiragana   |  Katakana   |
| --- | --- |
|     |  ヤ   |
|     |  カ   |
|     |   セ  |

Here's ones that are a stretch, but I'm using the Hiragana as the mnemonic effectively:

|  Hiragana   |  Katakana   |
| --- | --- |
|     |  キ   |


Alright, that leaves us with (38, oof. But don't worry):

| | a | i | u | e | o |
|--------|---|-----|-----|-----|----|
| ∅ | ア | イ |  | エ | オ |
| k |  |  | ク | ケ | コ |
| s | サ | シ | ス |  | ソ |
| t | タ | チ | ツ | テ | ト |
| n | ナ |  | ヌ | ネ | ノ |
| h | ハ | ヒ | フ |  | ホ |
| m | マ | ミ | ム | メ |  |
| y |  |  | ユ |  | ヨ |
| r | ラ |  | ル | レ | ロ |
| w | ワ | ヰ |  | ヱ | ヲ |
| ン (n) |

Firstly, counting from 1-3 in Japanese:

|  Number   |  Hiragana   | Katakana | Kanji |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1 ("ichi")  |  いち   | イチ   |  一   |
|   2 ("ni")  |  に   |  ニ   |  二   |
|   3 ("san") |   さん  |  サン   |  三   |

Although the katakana and kanji for 2 are not exactly the same (ニ vs 二), I think learning the numbers is simple enough, and then it makes learning the katakana for "ni" free

Here's the pictographic mnemonics I use:

| | a | i | u | e | o |
|--------|---|-----|-----|-----|----|
| ∅ | ア | イ |  | エ (elevator doors) | オ |
| k |  |  | ク (cook's hat) | ケ (sideways k? spelling makes it hard) | コ |
| s | サ (saddle? or socks drying) |  | ス (susan, bc it looks like a lambda) |  |  |
| t | タ (tamahawk? again, spelling) | チ |  | テ (te?) | ト touch your toes |
| n | ナ |  | ヌ | ネ |  |
| h | ハ | ヒ (heel, again!) | フ (hood?) |  | ホ (holy cross) |
| m | マ (mother's breast) | ミ | ム (mother's breast(under)) | メ (mexico) |  |
| y |  |  | ユ |  | ヨ |
| r | ラ |  | ル | レ | ロ (robot) |
| w | ワ |  |  |  | ヲ |
|  |

And here's the mental groupings I use for similar looking ones:

* ツ vs シ
  * "tsu" "shi", which isn't "sushi" but it's close lol 
    * the good mental model to use here is either they're facing away
    * OR even better: the stroke order for the bottom curve in "tsu" is the same in hiragana/katakana (right to left, and same for "shi" (left to right)
      * Try your best to see how hiragana strokes could line up with these characters theoretically
* ン (n) vs ソ vs ノ
  * ノ has *no* floating stroke
  * (again stroke order - closer to n??)...n for nico, how I rwite my o's?
  * so is a sock?
* チ (chi) | テ (te?) | ケ (ke) | 
  * te has hiragana char mirrored. Ke has k
  * chi has an I in it, should be ti (if you're good at remmebering NO TI, only CHI it'll work. Or if you wanna cheese typing)
* x is mexico, ナ (na) is "not" lmfao
* ハ ル
  * "*ha*lf" and other one is "*ru*ined" lmfao
    * technically ri is also a two stroker, but these are the only ones that point outwards. Plus ri is exactly the same, so hopefully doesn't get confused with these
* マ ム - ma , mu
  * mother's breast lol

 コ corner...ok
 ヨ yo....axe?
 ユ you go iron lol (you are number 1)
 ロ robot 
 
 ~~ヱ (*whe*n they finally went ironing)~~
 

ミ mi - middle line is ok i guess (also three lines, like do rey mi, but don't start thinking the number 3 is mi....)

レ (ready to fish..don't get confused with shi I guess....)

* チ (tu/chi) テ (te?) ケ (sideways k? spelling makes it hard)

* ヌ (nu way of writing 7...(spelling issue)) ネ (ne yen, but new)





*** ク ku.... - don't confuse with tomahawk... (cook's hat.... yeah I already forgot lol) ***
タ (tamahawk?  again, spelling (tomahawk))



ア a | イ easal (SPELLING) | オ opera |

 

ウ (u (oooo, pouring water (spelling))) ワ (wa(water in a wine glass)) vs  vs ヲ (wo(slow down, don't drink so fast))
ラ (ra, it's falling out) 

Don't get FU(fool'ed)ld by フ - there's no serif!!!

Note about u" - should be a v, which turns into b

stretching bar

--- 

digraphs are different --- hmm

---

notes for myself

I thought the fake phrase was "tsu - chi, which is double wrong"


first test results:

bad:
* i hate cook's hat, I keep wanting to say "chef's hat". But I still get it
* ra vs u....so tough
  * real u is not much better
* k looks like a cook's hat too!...grrr
* you go I want to make it just "go"...hmm
* letter a....not a tomahawk, not a cooks hat...hmmm

I see te, which is bad, because ta is also about seeing that word...rip

good;
* ti chi works actually
* na actually works, it's so bad


failed:
* so ...lol
* glass of WATER (in a wine glass)

* fu vs wa OH SHOOT
* EEEEE asl....again spelling....I doesn't work there, fRICK
