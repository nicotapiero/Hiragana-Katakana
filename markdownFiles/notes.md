##### notes for myself

day 2: I'm missing Ri (re --- took a while to get it the other way around)/Ke a lot

### Some background I started with

I should mention that I did Duolingo for a bit before learning Hiragana, and they teach you the following (super basic) words that helped me memorize a few characters:

- sensei (せんせい)
- sushi (すし)

As a result I never learned mnemonics for those really, sorry.

Also I kind of just learned "ko", "a", and "o" on their own. At the end, once you've covered most of the chart, it's easy to learn new characters simply as "the ones I don't recognize".

te/me lesson about body parts.... useful

another thing is that once you cover enough characters, mnemonics become stronger ! (knee is a good mnemonic once you won't get it confused for the others!)
